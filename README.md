# Customer-churn-Analysis
In the Project, I have tried to analyse the customer churn and the reasons behind it.
Churn refers to the rate at which customers are leaving a business entity.
The method of calculating churn rate varied from industry and revenue models.
Total No. of customers in the dataset  are 6687.
No. of churned customers are 1796.
Customer churn rate = No. of churned customer/ Total no. of customer.
Churn Rate=26.86% which means from every 100 customers 27 customers no longer custoemr of the company.

**Findings**
1. Most of the customers left because the competition has increased.
2.The competitors starts providing better offers(churn rate 37.64%), devices(36.89%) and more data( 13.66%).
3. The churn rate of Senior citizens is high which is 38.22%.
4. The data shows with the increase in age number of customers start decreasing(242 no. of senior citizen users) and churning rate starts increasng.
5. Those using less than 5GB data their churning rate(34.69%) is more than those using higher data(27.72%).
6. The States like CA(75%), IN(66.67%, NH(62.50%) have highest churn rate which is more than 60%.
7. SC and MT states has 0% churn rate.
   
 ** Suggestions**
   
1. There is a need to thoroughly understand the competitors plans and stretegies.
2. The plans should be made according to the need of the yunger generation so that these could be made loyal customers.
3. The plans which provide more data i.e. 10 GB we saw have low churn rate then we can made plans which provide more data. by doing this, more customers could be retained by us.
